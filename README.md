# Linear-Regression-Octave

This is a vectorised implementation of Linear regression in octave using the gradient descent algorithm. The implementation is broken up into different component methods as described below:

1. Compute Cost
   
   This computes the cost function for the target variables at each iteration of gradient descent.

2. plot Data
    
   This allows us to visualize and make informed decisions about the correct learning algorith to adopt. This is useful in this case because we have only two features.

3. Gradient Descent
   
   This is the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm.
